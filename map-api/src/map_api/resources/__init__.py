"""Exposes all of the resource endpoints mounted in Flask-Blueprint style.

Uses restplus namespaces to mount individual api endpoints into the service.

All services have 2 defaults sets of endpoints:
 - ops
 - meta
That are used to expose operational health information about the service, and meta information.
