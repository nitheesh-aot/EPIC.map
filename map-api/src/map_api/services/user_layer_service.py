"""Layers a user imports from a file of their own.

The widget parses the file and sends its features as gzipped GeoJSONSeq: one
WGS 84 feature per line. They are read a line at a time and inserted in
batches, so memory is bounded by a batch rather than by the file - the pod has
less memory than a large layer's GeoJSON. PostGIS repairs and reprojects each
geometry to BC Albers on the way in.

Nothing is committed until every feature has been read, so a refused file
leaves no layer behind.
